### Q: How do I start a new translation?

**Answer: ** 

welcome aboard , having a {language} translation would be awesome 🔥

Having a Hungarian translation would be great 👍

Before you start with this, we've prepared some basic workflow guidelines:

Work on your own fork - fork, create a branch, translate & collaborate with other translators, then open a PR
Focus on translation, not content editing - the focus is on translation, should anyone want to modify the content or the graphics - let's PR a draft in English first and then translate to other languages. Also the format of the text should remain intact (same design)
Duplicate the readme and the inner pages - the content should be translated over at a duplicated page, step by step. As an example, README.md would be come README.{translated-language}.md (e.g. README.french.md), all other files should be duplicated similarly. So the number of English & translated pages should be the same
Collaborate - once you setup the translation foundation (branch, duplicate pages), we can announce the work on a new language and get others involved to support you in translating (if you wish so, of course)
We're here to help - let us know whether we can do anything to support you. We can Tweet about this work, etc. 🚀
