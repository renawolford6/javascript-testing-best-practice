# 1.Section 1Ô∏è‚É£ : The Test Anatomy 

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 1.1 Include 3 parts in each test name

:white_check_mark: **Do:** A test report should tell whether the current application revision satisfies the requirements for the people who are not necessarily familiar with the code: the tester, the DevOps engineer who is deploying and the future you two years from now. This can be achieved best if the tests speak at the requirements level and include 3 parts:

(1) What is being tested? For example, the ProductsService.addNewProduct method

(2) Under what circumstances and scenario? For example, no price is passed to the method

(3) What is the expected result? For example, the new product is not approved

<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** A deployment just failed, a test named ‚ÄúAdd product‚Äù failed. Does this tell you what exactly is malfunctioning?

<br/>


### :clap: Doing It Right Example: A test name that constitutes 3 parts

```javascript
//1. unit under test
describe('Products Service', function() {
  describe('Add new product', function() {
    //2. scenario and 3. expectation
    it('When no price is specified, then the product status is pending approval', ()=> {
      const newProduct = new ProductService().add(...);
      expect(newProduct.status).to.equal('pendingApproval');
    });
  });
});

```
<br/>

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: A test name that constitutes 3 parts
![alt text](/assets/bp-1-3-parts.jpeg "A test name that constitutes 3 parts")

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 1.2 Structure tests by the AAA pattern

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Structure your tests with 3 well-separated sections Arrange, Act & Assert (AAA). Following this structure guarantees that the reader spends no brain CPU on understanding the test plan:

1st A - Arrange: All the setup code to bring the system to the scenario the test aims to simulate. This might include instantiating the unit under test constructor, adding DB records, mocking/stubbing on objects and any other preparation code

2nd A - Act: Execute the unit under test. Usually 1 line of code

3rd A - Assert: Ensure that the received value satisfies the expectation. Usually 1 line of code


<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** Not only you spend long daily hours on understanding the main code, now also what should have been the simple part of the day (testing) stretches your brain

<br/>


### :clap: Doing It Right Example: A test strcutured with the AAA pattern

```javascript
describe.skip('Customer classifier', () => {
    test('When customer spent more than 500$, should be classified as premium', () => {
        //Arrange
        const customerToClassify = {spent:505, joined: new Date(), id:1}
        const DBStub = sinon.stub(dataAccess, "getCustomer")
            .reply({id:1, classification: 'regular'});

        //Act
        const receivedClassification = customerClassifier.classifyCustomer(customerToClassify);

        //Assert
        expect(receivedClassification).toMatch('premium');
    });
});
```

<br/>

### :thumbsdown: Anti Pattern Example: No separation, one bulk, harder to interpret

```javascript
test('Should be classified as premium', () => {
        const customerToClassify = {spent:505, joined: new Date(), id:1}
        const DBStub = sinon.stub(dataAccess, "getCustomer")
            .reply({id:1, classification: 'regular'});
        const receivedClassification = customerClassifier.classifyCustomer(customerToClassify);
        expect(receivedClassification).toMatch('premium');
    });
```


<br/><br/>




## ‚ö™ Ô∏è1.3. Describe expectations in a product language: use BDD-style assertions

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Coding your tests in a declarative-style allows the reader to get the grab instantly without spending even a single brain-CPU cycle. When you write an imperative code that is packed with conditional logic the reader is thrown away to an effortful mental mood. In that sense, code the expectation in a human-like language, declarative BDD style using expect or should and not using custom code. If Chai & Jest don‚Äôt include the desired assertion and it‚Äôs highly repeatable, consider extending Jest matcher (Jest) or writing a custom Chai plugin
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** The team will write less test and decorate the annoying ones with .skip()
<br/>



### :thumbsdown: Anti Pattern Example: The reader must skim through not so short, and imperative code just to get the test story

```javascript
it("When asking for an admin, ensure only ordered admins in results" , ()={
    //assuming we've added here two admins "admin1", "admin2" and "user1"
    const allAdmins = getUsers({adminOnly:true});

    const admin1Found, adming2Found = false;

    allAdmins.forEach(aSingleUser => {
        if(aSingleUser === "user1"){
            assert.notEqual(aSingleUser, "user1", "A user was found and not admin");
        }
        if(aSingleUser==="admin1"){
            admin1Found = true;
        }
        if(aSingleUser==="admin2"){
            admin2Found = true;
        }
    });

    if(!admin1Found || !admin2Found ){
        throw new Error("Not all admins were returned");
    }
});

```
<br/>

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Skimming through the following declarative test is a breeze
```javascript
it("When asking for an admin, ensure only ordered admins in results" , ()={
    //assuming we've added here two admins
    const allAdmins = getUsers({adminOnly:true});

    expect(allAdmins).to.include.ordered.members(["admin1" , "admin2"])
  .but.not.include.ordered.members(["user1"]);
});

```

<br/><br/>


## ‚ö™ Ô∏è3. Lint with testing-dedicated plugins

:white_check_mark: **Do:**  A set of ESLint plugins were built specifically for inspecting the tests code patterns and discover issues. For example, eslint-plugin-mocha will warn when a test is written at the global level (not a son of a describe() statement) or when tests are skipped which might lead to a false belief that all tests are passing. Similarly, eslint-plugin-jest can, for example, warn when a test has no assertions at all (not checking anything)

<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** Seeing 90% code coverage and 100% green tests will make your face wear a big smile only until you realize that many tests aren‚Äôt asserting for anything and many test suites were just skipped. Hopefully, you didn‚Äôt deploy anything based on this false observation


<br/>


### :thumbsdown: Anti Pattern Example: A test case full of errors, luckily all are caught by Linters

```javascript
describe("Too short description", () => {
  const userToken = userService.getDefaultToken() // *error:no-setup-in-describe, use hooks (sparingly) instead
  it("Some description", () => {});//* error: valid-test-description. Must include the word "Should" + at least 5 words
});

it.skip("Test name", () => {// *error:no-skipped-tests, error:error:no-global-tests. Put tests only under describe or suite
  expect("somevalue"); // error:no-assert
});

it("Test name", () => {*//error:no-identical-title. Assign unique titles to tests
});
```

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è  4. Stick to black-box testing: Test only public methods

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Testing the internals brings huge overhead for almost nothing. If your code/API deliver the right results, should you really invest your next 3 hours in testing HOW it worked internally and then maintain these fragile tests? Whenever a public behavior is checked, the private implementation is also implicitly tested and your tests will break only if there is a certain problem (e.g. wrong output). This approach is also referred to as behavioral testing. On the other side, should you test the internals (white box approach)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyour focus shifts from planning the component outcome to nitty-gritty details and your test might break because of minor code refactors although the results are fine- this dramatically increases the maintenance burden
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** Your test behaves like the child who cries wolf: shoot out loud false-positive cries (e.g., A test fails because a private variable name was changed). Unsurprisingly, people will soon start to ignore the CI notifications until someday a real bug will get ignored‚Ä¶
<br/>


### :thumbsdown: Anti Pattern Example: A test case is testing the internals for no good reason
```javascript
class ProductService{
  //this method is only used internally
  //Change this name will make the tests fail
  calculateVAT(priceWithoutVAT){
    return {finalPrice: priceWithoutVAT * 1.2};
    //Change the result format or key name above will make the tests fail
  }
  //public method
  getPrice(productId){
    const desiredProduct= DB.getProduct(productId);
    finalPrice = this.calculateVATAdd(desiredProduct.price).finalPrice;
  }
}


it("White-box test: When the internal methods get 0 vat, it return 0 response", async () => {
    //There's no requirement to allow users to calculate the VAT, only show the final price. Nevertheless we falsely insist here to test the class internals
    expect(new ProductService().calculateVATAdd(0).finalPrice).to.equal(0);
});

```

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è Ô∏è5. Choose the right test doubles: Avoid mocks in favor of stubs and spies

:white_check_mark: **Do:**  Test doubles are a necessary evil because they are coupled to the application internals, yet some provide an immense valuespie <p name="becf" id="becf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">‚úÖ Do: </strong>Test doubles are a necessary evil because they are coupled to the application internals, yet some provide an immense value (<a href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html" data-href="https://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Read here a reminder about test doubles: mocks vs stubs vs spies</a>). However, the various techniques were not born equal: some of them, spies and stubs, are focused on testing the requirements but as an <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">inevitable side-effect</strong> they also slightly touch the internals. Mocks, on the contrary side, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">are focused on testing the internals</strong>‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis brings huge overhead as explained in the bullet ‚ÄúStick to black box testing‚Äù.</p>. However, the various techniques were not born equal: some of them, spies and stubs, are focused on testing the requirements but as an inevitable side-effect they also slightly touch the internals. Mocks, on the contrary side, are focused on testing the internals‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis brings huge overhead as explained in the bullet ‚ÄúStick to black box testing‚Äù.

Before using test doubles, ask a very simple question: Do I use it to test functionality that appears, or could appear, in the requirements document? If no, it‚Äôs a smell of white-box testing.

For example, if you want to test what your app behaves reasonably when the payment service is down, you might stub the payment service and trigger some ‚ÄòNo Response‚Äô return to ensure that the unit under test returns the right value. This checks our application behavior/response/outcome under certain scenarios. You might also use a spy to assert that an email was sent when that service is down‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis is again a behavioral check which is likely to appear in a requirements doc (‚ÄúSend an email if payment couldn‚Äôt be saved‚Äù). On the flip side, if you mock the Payment service and ensure that it was called with the right JavaScript types‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthen your test is focused on internal things that got nothing with the application functionality and are likely to change frequently
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** Any refactoring of code mandates searching for all the mocks in the code and updating accordingly. Tests become a burden rather than a helpful friend
<br/>

### :thumbsdown: Anti-pattern example: Mocks focus on the internals
```javascript
it("When a valid product is about to be deleted, ensure data access DAL was called once, with the right product and right config", async () => {
    //Assume we already added a product
    const dataAccessMock = sinon.mock(DAL);
    //hmmm BAD: testing the internals is actually our main goal here, not just a side-effecr
    dataAccessMock.expects("deleteProduct").once().withArgs(DBConfig, theProductWeJustAdded, true, false);
    new ProductService().deletePrice(theProductWeJustAdded);
    mock.verify();
});
```
<br/>

### :thumbsdown: Anti-pattern example: Mocks focus on the internals
```javascript
it("When a valid product is about to be deleted, ensure an email is sent", async () => {
    //Assume we already added here a product
    const spy = sinon.spy(Emailer.prototype, "sendEmail");
    new ProductService().deletePrice(theProductWeJustAdded);
    //hmmm OK: we deal with internals? Yes, but as a side effect of testing the requirements (sending an email)
});
```

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è6. Don‚Äôt ‚Äúfoo‚Äù, use realistic input dataing

:white_check_mark: **Do:**  Often production bugs are revealed under some very specific and surprising input‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe more realistic the test input is, the greater the chances are to catch bugs early. Use dedicated libraries like Faker to generate pseudo-real data that resembles the variety and form of production data. For example, such libraries will generate random yet realistic phone numbers, usernames, credit card, company names, and even ‚Äòlorem ipsum‚Äô text. Consider even importing real data from your production environment and use in your tests. Want to take it to the next level? see next bullet (property-based testing)
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** All your development testing will falsely seem green when you use synthetic inputs like ‚ÄúFoo‚Äù but then production might turn red when a hacker passes-in a nasty string like ‚Äú@3e2ddsf . ##‚Äô 1 fdsfds . fds432 AAAA‚Äù

<br/>


### :thumbsdown: Anti-Pattern Example: A test suite that passes due to non-realistic data
```javascript
const addProduct = (name, price) =>{
  const productNameRegexNoSpace = /^\S*$/;//no white-space allowd

  if(!productNameRegexNoSpace.test(name))
    return false;//this path never reached due to dull input

    //some logic here
    return true;
};

it("Wrong: When adding new product with valid properties, get successful confirmation", async () => {
    //The string "Foo" which is used in all tests never triggers a false result
    const addProductResult = addProduct("Foo", 5);
    expect(addProductResult).to.be.true;
    //Positive-false: the operation succeeded because we never tried with long
    //product name including spaces
});

```
<br/>

### :clap:Doing It Right Example: Randomizing realistic input
```javascript
it("Better: When adding new valid product, get successful confirmation", async () => {
    const addProductResult = addProduct(faker.commerce.productName(), faker.random.number());
    //Generated random input: {'Sleek Cotton Computer',  85481}
    expect(addProductResult).to.be.true;
    //Test failed, the random input triggered some path we never planned for.
    //We discovered a bug early!
});
```

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 7. Test many input combinations using Property-based testing

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Typically we choose a few input samples for each test. Even when the input format resembles real-world data (see bullet ‚ÄòDon‚Äôt foo‚Äô), we cover only a few input combinations (method(‚Äò‚Äô, true, 1), method(‚Äústring‚Äù , false‚Äù , 0)), However, in production, an API that is called with 5 parameters can be invoked with thousands of different permutations, one of them might render our process down (see Fuzz Testing). What if you could write a single test that sends 1000 permutations of different inputs automatically and catches for which input our code fails to return the right response? Property-based testing is a technique that does exactly that: by sending all the possible input combinations to your unit under test it increases the serendipity of finding a bug. For example, given a method‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäaddNewProduct(id, name, isDiscount)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe supporting libraries will call this method with many combinations of (number, string, boolean) like (1, ‚ÄúiPhone‚Äù, false), (2, ‚ÄúGalaxy‚Äù, true). You can run property-based testing using your favorite test runner (Mocha, Jest, etc) using libraries like js-verify or testcheck (much better documentation). Update: Nicolas Dubien suggests in the comments below to checkout fast-check which seems to offer some additional features and also to be actively maintained
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** Unconsciously, you choose the test inputs that cover only code paths that work well. Unfortunately, this decreases the efficiency of testing as a vehicle to expose bugs

<br/>


### :clap:  Doing It Right Example: Testing many input permutations with ‚Äúmocha-testcheck‚Äù

```javascript
require('mocha-testcheck').install();
const {expect} = require('chai');
const faker = require('faker');

describe('Product service', () => {
  describe('Adding new', () => {
    //this will run 100 times with different random properties
    check.it('Add new product with random yet valid properties, always successful',
      gen.int, gen.string, (id, name) => {
        expect(addNewProduct(id, name).status).to.equal('approved');
      });
  })
});

```

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 8. Stay within the test: Minimize external helpers and abstractions

:white_check_mark: **Do:** By now, it‚Äôs probably obvious that I‚Äôm advocating for dead-simple tests: The team can‚Äôt afford another software project that demands a mental effort to understand the code. Michael Lync explains this in his great post:

    Good production code is well-factored; good test code is obvious‚Ä¶When you write a test, think about the next developer who will see the test break. They don‚Äôt want to read your entire test suite, and they certainly don‚Äôt want to read a whole inheritance tree of test utilities.

Let the reader get the whole story without leaving the test, minimize utils, hooks, or any external effect on a test case. Too many repetitions and copy-pasting? OK, a test can leave with one external helper and stay obvious. But when it grows to three and four helpers and hooks it implies that it a complex structure is slowly forming

<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** Suddenly found yourself with 4 helpers per test suite, 2 of them inheriting from base util, a lot of setup and tearing-up hooks? congratulation, you just won another challenging project to maintain, you might write tests soon against your test suite
<br/>


### :thumbsdown: Anti-Pattern Example: Fancy and indirect test structure. Do you understand the test case without navigating to external dependencies?

```javascript
test("When getting orders report, get the existing orders", () => {
    const queryObject = QueryHelpers.getQueryObject(config.DBInstanceURL);
    const reportConfiguration = ReportHelpers.getReportConfig();//What report config did we get? have to leave the test and read
    userHelpers.prepareQueryPermissions(reportConfiguration);//what this one is doing? have to leave the test and read
    const result = queryObject.query(reportConfiguration);
    assertThatReportIsValid();//I wonder what this one does, have to leave the test and read
    expect(result).to.be.an('array').that.does.include({id:1, productd:2, orderStatus:"approved"});
    //how do we know this order exist? have to leave the test and check
})

```
<br/>

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: A test you may understand without hopping through different files
```javascript
it("When getting orders report, get the existing orders", () => {
    //This one hopefully is telling a direct and explicit story
    const orderWeJustAdded = ordersTestHelpers.addRandomNewOrder();
    const queryObject = newQueryObject(config.DBInstanceURL, queryOptions.deep, useCache:false);
    const result = queryObject.query(config.adminUserToken, reports.orders, pageSize:200);
    expect(result).to.be.an('array').that.does.include(orderWeJustAdded);
})

```
<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è9. Avoid global test fixtures and seeds, add data per-test

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Going by the golden rule (bullet 0), each test should add and act on its own set of DB rows to prevent coupling and easily reason about the test flow. In reality, this is often violated by testers who seed the DB with data before running the tests (also known as ‚Äòtest fixture‚Äô) for the sake of performance improvement. While performance is indeed a valid concern‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit can be mitigated (see ‚ÄúComponent testing‚Äù bullet), however, test complexity is a much painful sorrow that should govern other considerations most of the time. Practically, make each test case explicitly add the DB records it needs and act only on those records. If performance becomes a critical concern‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa balanced compromise might come in the form of seeding the only suite of tests that are not mutating data (e.g. queries)
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** Few tests fail, a deployment is aborted, our team is going to spend precious time now, do we have a bug? let‚Äôs investigate, oh no‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääit seems that two tests were mutating the same seed data
<br/>


### :thumbsdown: Anti Pattern Example: tests are not independent and rely on some global hook to feed global DB data

```javascript
before(() => {
  //adding sites and admins data to our DB. Where is the data? outside. At some external json or migration framework
  await DB.AddSeedDataFromJson('seed.json');
});
it("When updating site name, get successful confirmation", async () => {
  //I know that site name "portal" exists - I saw it in the seed files
  const siteToUpdate = await SiteService.getSiteByName("Portal");
  const updateNameResult = await SiteService.changeName(siteToUpdate, "newName");
  expect(updateNameResult).to.be(true);
});
it("When querying by site name, get the right site", async () => {
  //I know that site name "portal" exists - I saw it in the seed files
  const siteToCheck = await SiteService.getSiteByName("Portal");
  expect(siteToCheck.name).to.be.equal("Portal"); //Failure! The previous test change the name :[
});

```
<br/>

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: We can stay within the test, each test acts on its own set of data

```javascript
it("When updating site name, get successful confirmation", async () => {
  //test is adding a fresh new records and acting on the records only
  const siteUnderTest = await SiteService.addSite({
    name: "siteForUpdateTest"
  });
  const updateNameResult = await SiteService.changeName(siteUnderTest, "newName");
  expect(updateNameResult).to.be(true);
});

```

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 10. Don‚Äôt catch errors, expect them
:white_check_mark: **Do:**   When trying to assert that some input triggers an error, it might look right to use try-catch-finally and asserts that the catch clause was entered. The result is an awkward and verbose test case (example below) that hides the simple test intent and the result expectations

A more elegant alternative is the using the one-line dedicated Chai assertion: expect(method).to.throw (or in Jest: expect(method).toThrow()). It‚Äôs absolutely mandatory to also ensure the exception contains a property that tells the error type, otherwise given just a generic error the application won‚Äôt be able to do much rather than show a disappointing message to the user
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:**It will be challenging to infer from the test reports (e.g. CI reports) what went wrong

<br/>


### :thumbsdown: Anti-pattern Example: A long test case that tries to assert the existence of error with try-catch
```javascript
/it("When no product name, it throws error 400", async() => {
let errorWeExceptFor = null;
try {
  const result = await addNewProduct({name:'nest'});}
catch (error) {
  expect(error.code).to.equal('InvalidInput');
  errorWeExceptFor = error;
}
expect(errorWeExceptFor).not.to.be.null;
//if this assertion fails, the tests results/reports will only show
//that some value is null, there won't be a word about a missing Exception
});

```
<br/>

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: A human-readable expectation that could be understood easily, maybe even by QA or technical PM

```javascript
it.only("When no product name, it throws error 400", async() => {
  expect(addNewProduct)).to.eventually.throw(AppError).with.property('code', "InvalidInput");
});

```

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 10. Tag your tests

:white_check_mark: **Do:**  Different tests must run on different scenarios: quick smoke, IO-less, tests should run when a developer saves or commits a file, full end-to-end tests usually run when a new pull request is submitted, etc. This can be achieved by tagging tests with keywords like #cold #api #sanity so you can grep with your testing harness and invoke the desired subset. For example, this is how you would invoke only the sanity test group with Mocha: mocha‚Ää‚Äî‚Äägrep ‚Äòsanity‚Äô
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** Running all the tests, including tests that perform dozens of DB queries, any time a developer makes a small change can be extremely slow and keeps developers away from running tests
<br/>


### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Tagging tests as ‚Äò#cold-test‚Äô allows the test runner to execute only fast tests (Cold===quick tests that are doing no IO and can be executed frequently even as the developer is typing)
```javascript
//this test is fast (no DB) and we're tagging it correspondigly
//now the user/CI can run it frequently
describe('Order service', function() {
  describe('Add new order #cold-test #sanity', function() {
    it('Scenario - no currency was supplied. Excpectation - Use the default currency #sanity', function() {
      //code logic here
    });
  });
});


```

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è11. Other generic good testing hygiene
:white_check_mark: **Do:**  This post is focused on testing advice that is related to, or at least can be exemplified with Node JS. This bullet, however, groups few non-Node related tips that are well-known

Learn and practice TDD principles‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey are extremely valuable for many but don‚Äôt get intimidated if they don‚Äôt fit your style, you‚Äôre not the only one. Consider writing the tests before the code in a red-green-refactor style, ensure each test checks exactly one thing, when you find a bug‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbefore fixing write a test that will detect this bug in the future, let each test fail at least once before turning green, avoid any dependency on the environment (paths, OS, etc)
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:**You‚Äòll miss pearls of wisdom that were collected for decades

<br/><br/>

# Section 2Ô∏è‚É£ : Backend Testing

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è12. Enrich your testing portfolio: Look beyond unit tests and the pyramid

:white_check_mark: **Do:**  The testing pyramid, though 10 years old, is a great and relevant model that suggests three testing types and influences most developers‚Äô testing strategy. At the same time, more than a handful of shiny new testing techniques emerged and are hiding in the shadows of the testing pyramid. Given all the dramatic changes that we‚Äôve seen in the recent 10 years (Microservices, cloud, serverless), is it even possible that one quite-old model will suit *all* types of applications? shouldn‚Äôt the testing world consider welcoming new testing techniques?

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, in 2019 the testing pyramid, TDD and unit tests are still a powerful technique and are probably the best match for many applications. Only like any other model, despite its usefulness, it must be wrong sometimes. For example, consider an IOT application that ingests many events into a message-bus like Kafka/RabbitMQ, which then flow into some data-warehouse and are eventually queried by some analytics UI. Should we really spend 50% of our testing budget on writing unit tests for an application that is integration-centric and has almost no logic? As the diversity of application types increase (bots, crypto, Alexa-skills) greater are the chances to find scenarios where the testing pyramid is not the best match.

It‚Äôs time to enrich your testing portfolio and become familiar with more testing types (the next bullets suggest few ideas), mind models like the testing pyramid but also match testing types to real-world problems that you‚Äôre facing (‚ÄòHey, our API is broken, let‚Äôs write consumer-driven contract testing!‚Äô), diversify your tests like an investor that build a portfolio based on risk analysis‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääassess where problems might arise and match some prevention measures to mitigate those potential risks

A word of caution: the TDD argument in the software world takes a typical false-dichotomy face, some preach to use it everywhere, others think it‚Äôs the devil. Everyone who speaks in absolutes is wrong :]

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è13. Component testing might be your best affair

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Each unit test covers a tiny portion of the application and it‚Äôs expensive to cover the whole, whereas end-to-end testing easily covers a lot of ground but is flaky and slower, why not apply a balanced approach and write tests that are bigger than unit tests but smaller than end-to-end testing? Component testing is the unsung song of the testing world‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey provide the best from both worlds: reasonable performance and a possibility to apply TDD patterns + realistic and great coverage.

Component tests focus on the Microservice ‚Äòunit‚Äô, they work against the API, don‚Äôt mock anything which belongs to the Microservice itself (e.g. real DB, or at least the in-memory version of that DB) but stub anything that is external like calls to other Microservices. By doing so, we test what we deploy, approach the app from outwards to inwards and gain great confidence in a reasonable amount of time.
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** You may spend long days on writing unit tests to find out that you got only 20% system coverage

<br/>

![alt text](assets/bp-13-component-test-yoni-goldberg.png " Supertest allows approaching Express API in-process (fast and cover many layers)")

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è14. Ensure new releases don‚Äôt break the API using

:white_check_mark: **Do:**  So your Microservice has multiple clients, and you run multiple versions of the service for compatibility reasons (keeping everyone happy). Then you change some field and ‚Äòboom!‚Äô, some important client who relies on this field is angry. This is the Catch-22 of the integration world: It‚Äôs very challenging for the server side to consider all the multiple client expectations‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäOn the other hand, the clients can‚Äôt perform any testing because the server controls the release dates. Consumer-driven contracts and the framework PACT were born to formalize this process with a very disruptive approach‚Ää‚Äî‚Äänot the server defines the test plan of itself rather the client defines the tests of the‚Ä¶ server! PACT can record the client expectation and put in a shared location, ‚Äúbroker‚Äù, so the server can pull the expectations and run on every build using PACT library to detect broken contracts‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa client expectation that is not met. By doing so, all the server-client API mismatches are caught early during build/CI and might save you a great deal of frustration
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** The alternatives are exhausting manual testing or deployment fear

<br/>

### :clap: Doing It Right Example:

<br/><br/>


## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 15. Test your middlewares in isolation

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Many avoid Middleware testing because they represent a small portion of the system and require a live Express server. Both reasons are wrong‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäMiddlewares are small but affect all or most of the requests and can be tested easily as pure functions that get {req,res} JS objects. To test a middleware function one should just invoke it and spy (using Sinon for example) on the interaction with the {req,res} objects to ensure the function performed the right action. The library node-mock-http takes it even further and factors the {req,res} objects along with spying on their behavior. For example, it can assert whether the http status that was set on the res object matches the expectation (See example below)
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** A bug in Express middleware === a bug in all or most requests

<br/>


### :clap:Doing It Right Example: Testing middleware in isolation without issuing network calls and waking-up the entire Express machine
```javascript
//the middleware we want to test
const unitUnderTest = require('./middleware')
const httpMocks = require('node-mocks-http');
//Jest syntax, equivelant to describe() & it() in Mocha
test('A request without authentication header, should return http status 403', () => {
  const request = httpMocks.createRequest({
    method: 'GET',
    url: '/user/42',
    headers: {
      authentication: ''
    }
  });
  const response = httpMocks.createResponse();
  unitUnderTest(request, response);
  expect(response.statusCode).toBe(403);
});

```

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è16. Measure and refactor using static analysis tools
:white_check_mark: **Do:** Using static analysis tools helps by giving objective ways to improve code quality and keep your code maintainable. You can add static analysis tools to your CI build to abort when it finds code smells. Its main selling points over plain linting are the ability to inspect quality in the context of multiple files (e.g. detect duplications), perform advanced analysis (e.g. code complexity) and follow the history and progress of code issues. Two examples of tools you can use are Sonarqube (2,600+ stars) and Code Climate (1,500+ stars)

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 17. Check your readiness for Node-related chaos
:white_check_mark: **Do:** Weirdly, most software testings are about logic & data only, but some of the worst things that happen (and are really hard to mitigate ) are infrastructural issues. For example, did you ever test what happens when your process memory is overloaded, or when the server/process dies, or does your monitoring system realizes when the API becomes 50% slower?. To test and mitigate these type of bad things‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäChaos engineering was born by Netflix. It aims to provide awareness, frameworks and tools for testing our app resiliency for chaotic issues. For example, one of its famous tools, the chaos monkey, randomly kills servers to ensure that our service can still serve users and not relying on a single server (there is also a Kubernetes version, kube-monkey, that kills pods). All these tools work on the hosting/platform level, but what if you wish to test and generate pure Node chaos like check how your Node process copes with uncaught errors, unhandled promise rejection, v8 memory overloaded with the max allowed of 1.7GB or whether your UX stays satisfactory when the event loop gets blocked often? to address this I‚Äôve written, node-chaos (alpha) which provides all sort of Node-related chaotic acts

# Section 3Ô∏è‚É£: Frontend Testing

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 3.1. Separate UI from functionality

:white_check_mark: **Do:** When focused on testing component's logic, the UI details becomes a noise that should be extracted-out so your tests can focus on pure data. Practically, extract the desired data from the markup in an abstract way that is not too coupled to the graphic implementation, assert only on pure data (vs HTML/CSS graphic details) and disable animations that slow down. You might get tempted to avoid rendering and test only thge back part of the UI (e.g. services, actions, store) but this will result in artifical tests that doesn't resemeble the reality and won't reveal cases where the right data doesn't arrive to the UI

<br/>

:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** The pure calculated data of your test might be ready in 10ms, but then the whole test will last 500ms (100 tests = 1 min) due to some fancy and irrelevant animation

<br/>

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Separating out the UI details
```javascript
test('When users-list is flagged to show only VIP, should display only VIP members', () => {
  //Arrange
  const allUsers = [{id:1 , name: 'Yoni Goldberg', vip: false}, 
   {id:2 , name: 'John Doe', vip: true}];

  //Act
  const {getAllByTestId} = render(<UsersList users={allUsers} showOnlyVIP={true}/>);

  //Assert - Extract the data from the UI first
  const allRenderedUsers = getAllByTestId('user').map(uiElement => uiElement.textContent);
  const allRealVIPUsers = allUsers.filter((user) => user.vip).map((user) => user.name);
  expect(allRenderedUsers).toEqual(allRealVIPUsers);//compare data with data, no UI here
});

```

<br/>

### :thumbsdown: Anti Pattern Example: Assertion mix UI details and data
```javascript
test('When flagging to show only VIP, should display only VIP members', () => {
  //Arrange
  const allUsers = [{id:1 , name: 'Yoni Goldberg', vip: false}, 
   {id:2 , name: 'John Doe', vip: true}];

  //Act
  const {getAllByTestId} = render(<UsersList users={allUsers} showOnlyVIP={true}/>);

  //Assert - Mix UI & data in assertion
  expect(getAllByTestId('user')).toEqual('[<li data-testid="user">John Doe</li>]');
});

```

<br/><br/>


## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 3.2. Query HTML elements based on attributes that are unlikely to change

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Query HTML elements based on attributes that are likely to survive graphic changes unlike css selectors and like form labels. If the desginated element doesn't have such attributes, create a dedicated test attribute like 'test-id-submit-button'. Going this route not only ensures that your functional/logic tests never break because of look&feel changes, but also it becomes clear to the entire team that this element and attribute are utilized by tests and shouldn't get removed

<br/>

:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** You want to test the login functionality that spans many components, logic and services, everything is setup perfectly - stubs, spies, Ajax calls are isolated. All seems perfect. Then the test fails because the designer changed the div css class from 'thick-border' to 'thin-border'

<br/>


### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Querying an element using a dedicated attrbiute for testing
```html
//the markup code (part of React component)
<h3>
              <Badge pill className="fixed_badge" variant="dark">
                <span data-testid="errorsLabel">{value}</span> //note the attribute data-testid
              </Badge>
            </h3>
```

```javascript
//this example is using react-testing-library
  test('Whenever no data is passed to metric, show 0 as default', () => {
    //Arrange
    const metricValue = undefined;

    //Act
    const { getByTestId } = render(<dashboardMetric value={undefined}/>);    
    
    expect(getByTestId('errorsLabel')).text()).toBe("0");
  });

```

<br/>

### :thumbsdown: Anti-Pattern Example: Relying on CSS attributes
```html
//the markup code (part of React component)
<span id="metric" className="d-flex-column">{value}</span>//what if the designer changes the classs?
```

```javascript
//this exammple is using enzyme
test('Whenever no data is passed, error metric shows zero', () => {
    //...
    
    expect(wrapper.find("[className='d-flex-column']").text()).toBe("0");
  });
```

<br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 3.3. Whenever possible, test with a realistic and fully rendered component

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Whenver reasonably sized, test your component from outside like your users do, fully render the UI, act on it and assert that the rendered UI behaves as expected. Avoid all sort of mocking, partial and shallow rendering - this approach might result in untrapped bugs due to lack of details and harden the maintenance as the tests mess with the internals (see bullet 'Favour blackbox testing'). If one of the child components is significantly slowing down (e.g. animation) or complicating the setup - consider explicitly replacing it with a fake

With all that said, a word of caution is in order: this technique works for small/medium components that packs a reasonable size of child components. Fully rendering a component with too many childs will make it hard to reason about test failures (root cause analysis) and might get too slow. In such cases, write only few tests against that fat parent component and more tests against its childs

<br/>

:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** When poking into a component's internal by invoking its private methods, and checking the inner state - you would have to refactor all tests when refactoring the components implementation. Do you really have a capacity for this level of maintenance?

<br/>

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Working realstically with a fully rendered component

```javascript
class Calendar extends React.Component {
  static defaultProps = {showFilters: false}
  
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        A filters panel with a button to hide/show filters
        <FiltersPanel showFilter={showFilters} title='Choose Filters'/>
      </div>
    )
  }
}

//Examples use React & Enzyme
test('Realistic approach: When clicked to show filters, filters are displayed', () => {
    //Arrange
    const wrapper = mount(<Calendar showFilters={false} />)

    //Act
    wrapper.find('button').simulate('click');

    //Assert
    expect(wrapper.text().includes('Choose Filter'));
    //This is how the user will approach this element: by text
})


```

### :thumbsdown: Anti-Pattern Example: Mocking the reality with shallow rendering
```javascript

test('Shallow/mocked approach: When clicked to show filters, filters are displayed', () => {
    //Arrange
    const wrapper = shallow(<Calendar showFilters={false} title='Choose Filter'/>)

    //Act
    wrapper.find('filtersPanel').instance().showFilters();
    //Tap into the internals, bypass the UI and invoke a method. White-box approach

    //Assert
    expect(wrapper.find('Filter').props()).toEqual({title: 'Choose Filter'});
    //what if we change the prop name or don't pass anything relevant?
})

```

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 3.6. Stub flakky and slow resources like backend APIs

:white_check_mark: **Do:** When mainstream, don't allow your component, rather Stub 3rd party APIs or anything external that is beyond control. The first and foremos reason is flakiness... The reason for this is 3 fold: your test will suffer from Flakiness
main reason is to simulate, flakiness, slow. This stubbing can be achieved in different techniques: stub and intercepting

There is a room for tests that... E2E

<br/>

:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** The average test runs no longer than few ms, a typical API call last 100ms>, this makes each test ~20x slower

      setProducts(products);
    }

:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** Explanation here

<br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 3.8. Have one E2E smoke test that just travells across the site map

:white_check_mark: **Do:** For production monitoring and development-time sanity check, run a single E2E test that visits all/most of the site pages and ensure no one breaks. This type of test brings great return on investement as it's very easy to write and maintain, but it can detect any kind of failure including functional, network and deployment issues. Other style of smoke and sanity checking are not as reliable and exahustive - some ops teams just ping the home page (production) or developers who run many integration tests which doesn't discover packaging and browser issues. Goes without saying that smoke test doesn't replace functional tests rather just aim to server as a quick smoke detector

    cy.visit('https://mysite.com/home');
    cy.contains('Home');

:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** Explanation here

<br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 3.10. Expose the tests as a live collaborative document

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Besides increasing app reliability, tests brings another attractive opprtunity to the table - serve as a live app documentation. Since tests inherently speak at a less-technical and product/UX language, using the right tools they can serve as a communication artifact that greatly aligns all the peers - developers and their customers. For example, some frameworks allow expressing the flow and expectations (i.e. tests plan) using a human-readable language so any stakeholder, including product managers, can read, approve and collaborate on the tests which just became the live requirements document. This technique is also being referred to as 'acceptance test' as it allows the customer to define his acceptance criteria in plain languae. This is [BDD (behaviour-driven testing)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) at its purest form. One of the popular frameworks that enable this is [Cocumber which has a JavaScript flavour](https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber-js), see example below. Another similar yet different opprtunity, [StoryBook](https://storybook.js.org/), allows exposing UI components as a graphic catalog where one can walk through the various states of each component (e.g. render a grid w/o filters, render that grid with multiple rows or with none, etc), see how it looks like, and how to trigger that state - this can appeal also to product folks but mostly serves as live doc for developers who consume those components.

:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** After investing top resources on testing, it's just a pity not to leverage this investment and win great value

<br/>

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Describing tests in human-language using cocumber-js

```javascript
//this is how one can describe tests using cocumber: plain language that allows anyone to understand and collaborate

Feature: Twitter new tweet
 
  I want to tweet something in Twitter
  
  @focus
  Scenario: Tweeting from the home page
    Given I open Twitter home
    Given I click on "New tweet" button
    Given I type "Hello followers!" in the textbox 
    Given I click on "Submit" button

# Section 4Ô∏è‚É£: Measuring Test Effectiveness

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 18. Get enough coverage for being confident, ~80% seems to be the lucky number

:white_check_mark: **Do:** The purpose of testing is to get enough confidence for moving fast, obviously the more code is tested the more confident the team can be. Coverage is a measure of how many code lines (and branches, statements, etc) are being reached by the tests. So how much is enough? 10‚Äì30% is obviously too low to get any sense about the build correctness, on the other side 100% is very expensive and might shift your focus from the critical paths to the exotic corners of the code. The long answer is that it depends on many factors like the type of application‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääif you‚Äôre building the next generation of Airbus A380 than 100% is a must, for a cartoon pictures website 50% might be too much. Although most of the testing enthusiasts claim that the right coverage threshold is contextual, most of them also mention the number 80% as a thumb of a rule (Fowler: ‚Äúin the upper 80s or 90s‚Äù) that presumably should satisfy most of the applications.

Implementation tips: You may want to configure your continuous integration (CI) to have a coverage threshold (Jest link) and stop a build that doesn‚Äôt stand to this standard (it‚Äôs also possible to configure threshold per component, see code example below). On top of this, consider detecting build coverage decrease (when a newly committed code has less coverage)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis will push developers raising or at least preserving the amount of tested code. All that said, coverage is only one measure, a quantitative based one, that is not enough to tell the robustness of your testing. And it can also be fooled as illustrated in the next bullets

<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:**  Confidence and numbers go hand in hand, without really knowing that you tested most of the system‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthere will also be some fear. and fear will slow you down

<br/>

### :clap: Example: A typical coverage report

<br/>

### :clap: Doing It Right Example: Setting up coverage per component (using Jest)
![alt text](assets/bp-18-code-coverage2.jpeg "Setting up coverage per component (using Jest)")

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 19. Inspect coverage reports to detect untested areas and other oddities

:white_check_mark: **Do:** Some issues sneak just under the radar and are really hard to find using traditional tools. These are not really bugs but more of surprising application behavior that might have a severe impact. For example, often some code areas are never or rarely being invoked‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou thought that the ‚ÄòPricingCalculator‚Äô class is always setting the product price but it turns out it is actually never invoked although we have 10000 products in DB and many sales‚Ä¶ Code coverage reports help you realize whether the application behaves the way you believe it does. Other than that, it can also highlight which types of code is not tested‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbeing informed that 80% of the code is tested doesn‚Äôt tell whether the critical parts are covered. Generating reports is easy‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääjust run your app in production or during testing with coverage tracking and then see colorful reports that highlight how frequent each code area is invoked. If you take your time to glimpse into this data‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou might find some gotchas
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** If you don‚Äôt know which parts of your code are left un-tested, you don‚Äôt know where the issues might come from

<br/>

### :thumbsdown: Anti-Pattern Example: What‚Äôs wrong with this coverage report? based on a real-world scenario where we tracked our application usage in QA and find out interesting login patterns (Hint: the amount of login failures is non-proportional, something is clearly wrong. Finally it turned out that some frontend bug keeps hitting the backend login API)
![alt text](assets/bp-19-coverage-yoni-goldberg-nodejs-consultant.png "What‚Äôs wrong with this coverage report? based on a real-world scenario where we tracked our application usage in QA and find out interesting login patterns (Hint: the amount of login failures is non-proportional, something is clearly wrong.

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 20. Measure logical coverage using mutation testing

:white_check_mark: **Do:**  The Traditional Coverage metric often lies: It may show you 100% code coverage, but none of your functions, even not one, return the right response. How come? it simply measures over which lines of code the test visited, but it doesn‚Äôt check if the tests actually tested anything‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääasserted for the right response. Like someone who‚Äôs traveling for business and showing his passport stamps‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthis doesn‚Äôt prove any work done, only that he visited few airports and hotels.

Mutation-based testing is here to help by measuring the amount of code that was actually TESTED not just VISITED. Stryker is a JavaScript library for mutation testing and the implementation is really neat:

(1) it intentionally changes the code and ‚Äúplants bugs‚Äù. For example the code newOrder.price===0 becomes newOrder.price!=0. This ‚Äúbugs‚Äù are called mutations

(2) it runs the tests, if all succeed then we have a problem‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthe tests didn‚Äôt serve their purpose of discovering bugs, the mutations are so-called survived. If the tests failed, then great, the mutations were killed.

Knowing that all or most of the mutations were killed gives much higher confidence than traditional coverage and the setup time is similar
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** You‚Äôll be fooled to believe that 85% coverage means your test will detect bugs in 85% of your code
<br/>

### :thumbsdown: Anti Pattern Example: 100% coverage, 0% testing
```javascript
function addNewOrder(newOrder) {
    logger.log(`Adding new order ${newOrder}`);
    DB.save(newOrder);
    Mailer.sendMail(newOrder.assignee, `A new order was places ${newOrder}`);

    return {approved: true};
}

it("Test addNewOrder, don't use such test names", () => {
    addNewOrder({asignee: "John@mailer.com",price: 120});
});//Triggers 100% code coverage, but it doesn't check anything

```

# Section 5Ô∏è‚É£ CI and Other Quality Measures

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 21. Enrich your linters and abort builds that have linting issues

:white_check_mark: **Do:**  Linters are a free lunch, with 5 min setup you get for free an auto-pilot guarding your code and catching significant issue as you type. Gone are the days where linting was about cosmetics (no semi-colons!). Nowadays, Linters can catch severe issues like errors that are not thrown correctly and losing information. On top of your basic set of rules (like ESLint standard or Airbnb style), consider including some specializing Linters like eslint-plugin-chai-expect that can discover tests without assertions, eslint-plugin-promise can discover promises with no resolve (your code will never continue), eslint-plugin-security which can discover eager regex expressions that might get used for DOS attacks, and eslint-plugin-you-dont-need-lodash-underscore is capable of alarming when the code uses utility library methods that are part of the V8 core methods like Lodash._map(‚Ä¶)
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** Consider a rainy day where your production keeps crashing but the logs don‚Äôt display the error stack trace. What happened? Your code mistakenly threw a non-error object and the stack trace was lost, a good reason for banging your head against a brick wall. A 5min linter setup could detect this TYPO and save your day
<br/>

### :thumbsdown: Anti Pattern Example: The wrong Error object is thrown mistakenly, no stack-trace will appear for this error. Luckily, ESLint catches the next production bug

<br/><br/>

# ‚ö™ Ô∏è 22. Shorten the feedback loop with local developer-CI

:white_check_mark: **Do:**   Using a CI with shiny quality inspections like testing, linting, vulnerabilities check, etc? Help developers run this pipeline also locally to solicit instant feedback and shorten the feedback loop. Why? an efficient testing process constitutes many and iterative loops: (1) try-outs -> (2) feedback -> (3) refactor. The faster the feedback is, the more improvement iterations a developer can perform per-module and perfect the results. On the flip, when the feedback is late to come fewer improvement iterations could be packed into a single day, the team might already move forward to another topic/task/module and might not be up for refining that module.

Practically, some CI vendors (Example: CircleCI load CLI) allow running the pipeline locally. Some commercial tools like wallaby provide highly-valuable & testing insights as a developer prototype (no affiliation). Alternatively, you may just add npm script to package.json that runs all the quality commands (e.g. test, lint, vulnerabilities)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääuse tools like concurrently for parallelization and non-zero exit code if one of the tools failed. Now the developer should just invoke one command‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääe.g. ‚Äònpm run quality‚Äô‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto get instant feedback. Consider also aborting a commit if the quality check failed using a githook (husky can help)
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** When the quality results arrive the day after the code, testing doesn‚Äôt become a fluent part of development rather an after the fact formal artifact
<br/>


### :clap:  Doing It Right Example: npm scripts that perform code quality inspection, all are run in parallel on demand or when a developer is trying to push new code
```javascript
"scripts": {
    "inspect:sanity-testing": "mocha **/**--test.js --grep \"sanity\"",
    "inspect:lint": "eslint .",
    "inspect:vulnerabilities": "npm audit",
    "inspect:license": "license-checker --failOn GPLv2",
    "inspect:complexity": "plato .",

    "inspect:all": "concurrently -c \"bgBlue.bold,bgMagenta.bold,yellow\" \"npm:inspect:quick-testing\" \"npm:inspect:lint\" \"npm:inspect:vulnerabilities\" \"npm:inspect:license\""
  },
  "husky": {
    "hooks": {
      "precommit": "npm run inspect:all",
      "prepush": "npm run inspect:all"
    }
}

```

<br/><br/>

# ‚ö™ Ô∏è23. Perform e2e testing over a true production-mirror

:white_check_mark: **Do:**   End to end (e2e) testing are the main challenge of every CI pipeline‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääcreating an identical ephemeral production mirror on the fly with all the related cloud services can be tedious and expensive. Finding the best compromise is your game: Docker-compose allows crafting isolated dockerized environment with identical containers using a single plain text file but the backing technology (e.g. networking, deployment model) is different from real-world productions. You may combine it with ‚ÄòAWS Local‚Äô to work with a stub of the real AWS services. If you went serverless multiple frameworks like serverless and AWS SAM allows the local invocation of Faas code.

The huge Kubernetes eco-system is yet to formalize a standard convenient tool for local and CI-mirroring though many new tools are launched frequently. One approach is running a ‚Äòminimized-Kubernetes‚Äô using tools like Minikube and MicroK8s which resemble the real thing only come with less overhead. Another approach is testing over a remote ‚Äòreal-Kubernetes‚Äô, some CI providers (e.g. Codefresh) has native integration with Kubernetes environment and make it easy to run the CI pipeline over the real thing, others allow custom scripting against a remote Kubernetes.
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** Using different technologies for production and testing demands maintaining two deployment models and keeps the developers and the ops team separated
<br/>

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è24. Parallelize test execution
:white_check_mark: **Do:**    When done right, testing is your 24/7 friend providing almost instant feedback. In practice, executing 500 CPU-bounded unit test on a single thread can take too long. Luckily, modern test runners and CI platforms (like Jest, AVA and Mocha extensions) can parallelize the test into multiple processes and achieve significant improvement in feedback time. Some CI vendors do also parallelize tests across containers (!) which shortens the feedback loop even further. Whether locally over multiple processes, or over some cloud CLI using multiple machines‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääparallelizing demand keeping the tests autonomous as each might run on different processes


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** Getting test results 1 hour long after pushing new code, as you already code the next features, is a great recipe for making testing less relevant
<br/>

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è25. Stay away from legal issues using license and plagiarism check
:white_check_mark: **Do:**    Licensing and plagiarism issues are probably not your main concern right now, but why not tick this box as well in 10 minutes? A bunch of npm packages like license check and plagiarism check (commercial with free plan) can be easily baked into your CI pipeline and inspect for sorrows like dependencies with restrictive licenses or code that was copy-pasted from Stackoverflow and apparently violates some copyrights

:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** Unintentionally, developers might use packages with inappropriate licenses or copy paste commercial code and run into legal issues
<br/>


### :clap: Doing It Right Example:
```javascript
//install license-checker in your CI environment or also locally
npm install -g license-checker

//ask it to scan all licenses and fail with exit code other than 0 if it found unauthorized license. The CI system should catch this failure and stop the build
license-checker --summary --failOn BSD

```

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è26. Constantly inspect for vulnerable dependencies
:white_check_mark: **Do:**    Licensing and plagiarism issues are probably not your main concern right now, but why not tick this box as well in 10 minutes? A bunch of npm packages like license check and plagiarism check (commercial with free plan) can be easily baked into your CI pipeline and inspect for sorrows like dependencies with restrictive licenses or code that was copy-pasted from Stackoverflow and apparently violates some copyrights
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** Even the most reputable dependencies such as Express have known vulnerabilities. This can get easily tamed using community tools such as npm audit, or commercial tools like snyk (offer also a free community version). Both can be invoked from your CI on every build
<br/>

### :clap: Example: NPM Audit result
![alt text](assets/bp-26-npm-audit-snyk.png "NPM Audit result")

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è27. Automate dependency updates
:white_check_mark: **Do:**   Yarn and npm latest introduction of package-lock.json introduced a serious challenge (the road to hell is paved with good intentions)‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääby default now, packages are no longer getting updates. Even a team running many fresh deployments with ‚Äònpm install‚Äô & ‚Äònpm update‚Äô won‚Äôt get any new updates. This leads to subpar dependent packages versions at best or to vulnerable code at worst. Teams now rely on developers goodwill and memory to manually update the package.json or use tools like ncu manually. A more reliable way could be to automate the process of getting the most reliable dependency versions, though there are no silver bullet solutions yet there are two possible automation roads: (1) CI can fail builds that have obsolete dependencies‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääusing tools like ‚Äònpm outdated‚Äô or ‚Äònpm-check-updates (ncu)‚Äô . Doing so will enforce developers to update dependencies. (2) Use commercial tools that scan the code and automatically send pull requests with updated dependencies. One interesting question remaining is what should be the dependency update policy‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääupdating on every patch generates too many overhead, updating right when a major is released might point to an unstable version (many packages found vulnerable on the very first days after being released, see the eslint-scope incident). An efficient update policy may allow some ‚Äòvesting period‚Äô‚Ää‚Äî‚Äälet the code lag behind the @latest for some time and versions before considering the local copy as obsolete (e.g. local version is 1.3.1 and repository version is 1.3.8)
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** Your production will run packages that have been explicitly tagged by their author as risky
<br/>

### :clap:  Example: ncu can be used manually or within a CI pipeline to detect to which extent the code lag behind the latest versions

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 28. Other, non-Node related, CI tips
:white_check_mark: **Do:**    This post is focused on testing advice that is related to, or at least can be exemplified with Node JS. This bullet, however, groups few non-Node related tips that are well-known

Caching node_modules might be the only exception</li></ol>
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** You‚Äòll miss years of wisdom

<br/><br/>

## ‚ö™ Ô∏è 29. Build matrix: Run the same CI steps using multiple Node versions
:white_check_mark: **Do:** Quality checking is about serendipity, the more ground you cover the luckier you get in detecting issues early. When developing reusable packages or running a multi-customer production with various configuration and Node versions, the CI must run the pipeline of tests over all the permutations of configurations. For example, assuming we use mySQL for some customers and Postgres for others‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääsome CI vendors support a feature called ‚ÄòMatrix‚Äô which allow running the suit of testing against all permutations of mySQL, Postgres and multiple Node version like 8, 9 and 10. This is done using configuration only without any additional effort (assuming you have testing or any other quality checks). Other CIs who doesn‚Äôt support Matrix might have extensions or tweaks to allow that
<br/>


:negative_squared_cross_mark: **Otherwise:** So after doing all that hard work of writing testing are we going to let bugs sneak in only because of configuration issues?
<br/>

### :clap:   Example: Using Travis (CI vendor) build definition to run the same test over multiple Node versions
